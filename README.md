Installation

 Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Flask
-flask-cors
- Web browser with JavaScript enabled

 Backend Setup

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Business_Metrics.git
cd Business_Metrics
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Place your trained model in the checkpoints directory:
```bash
mkdir checkpoints
cp path/to/your/model.pt checkpoints/
```

Frontend Setup
No additional setup required - just serve the HTML file using any web server.

Usage

Starting the Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

Starting the Frontend
1. Serve the frontend using a simple HTTP server:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

3. Click the "Analyze Business" button to fetch and display insights
